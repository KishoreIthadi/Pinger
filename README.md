### **What is PINGER?**
**Pinger is a simple but elegant chrome browser extension to monitor the status of a remote server, website or a remoteDB from your chrome browser.**

---

### **Features**
- Pinger lets you check the status and be notified about the status of any remote server, website or a remoteDB.

- Pinger notifies you on chrome by push notification as well as via email.

- Pinger allows you to configure how frequently you want to check the status.

- **Note**:
    >- **Pinger will run in the background even when the browser is closed. When running in the background an icon is added in the notification tray of the task bar**

    >- **Pinger will only track the status of IP's and URL's which are publicly exposed. Therefore you will not be able to track the IP's and localhost within your domain.**
    >- **If you clear the history of your chrome browser pinger will get reset, you will lose all your existing data in the pinger extension.**

#### **Status Icons**
